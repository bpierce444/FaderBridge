# FaderBridge Project Journal

> **Purpose:** This journal tracks high-level progress, decisions, blockers, and learnings. It is the single source of truth for "What happened and why?"

---

## How to Use This Journal

### When to Update (MANDATORY)
- ✅ After completing a major milestone (e.g., "UCNet connection working")
- ✅ After making an architectural decision (link to ADR)
- ✅ When encountering a significant blocker or bug
- ✅ At the end of each work session (even if incomplete)
- ✅ When changing scope or priorities

### Entry Format
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD - [Session Title]
**Duration:** [X hours]
**Phase:** [Phase 1 MVP / Phase 2 / etc.]
**Status:** [On Track / Blocked / At Risk]

### What Was Accomplished
- [Bullet points of concrete progress]

### What Was Learned
- [Technical insights, gotchas, discoveries]

### Blockers / Issues
- [What's preventing progress, if anything]

### Next Steps
- [What to work on next session]

## 2025-11-20 - Project Planning & Documentation
**Duration:** ~4 hours
**Phase:** Phase 0 (Planning)
**Status:** On Track ✅

### What Was Accomplished
- Created comprehensive PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- Established project name: **FaderBridge**
- Defined technology stack: Tauri v2 + Rust + React (TypeScript)
- Created governance framework:
  - `Docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` - Scope boundaries and success criteria
  - `.windsurf/rules/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` - Quality gates for all work (Windsurf rules)
  - `Docs/FEATURE_PRIORITIZATION.md` - Decision framework for features
  - `Docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` - Technical decision log (6 ADRs documented)
  - `.windsurf/rules/AI_CODING_RULES.md` - Windsurf-compatible agent rules
  - `Docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` - UI/UX standards ("Dark Room Standard")
  - `Docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` - Testing approach (Vitest + Cargo)
- Confirmed UCNet works over both network (UDP/TCP) and USB
- Moved AI_CODING_RULES.md and DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md to `.windsurf/rules/` for automatic Windsurf detection
- Created comprehensive task management system:
  - `Tasks/TASK_TEMPLATE.md` - Template for all task files
  - `Tasks/README.md` - Task management overview and best practices
  - `.windsurf/workflows/create-task.md` - Workflow for creating new tasks
  - `.windsurf/workflows/update-task.md` - Workflow for updating task progress
  - `.windsurf/workflows/list-tasks.md` - Workflow for viewing all tasks
  - `.windsurf/workflows/task-dependencies.md` - Workflow for dependency visualization
  - `Docs/TASK_MANAGEMENT_RULES.md` - Mandatory rules for task management
- Connected project to GitHub repository: https://github.com/bpierce444/FaderBridge
- Created comprehensive README.md with project overview, roadmap, and documentation links
- Added MIT License
- Created .gitignore for Tauri/Rust/Node projects
- Initial commit pushed to main branch (19 files, 1880+ lines)
- Created all 7 Phase 1 MVP task files:
  - TASK-001: UCNet device discovery (network + USB)
  - TASK-002: MIDI device enumeration
  - TASK-003: Basic parameter mapping (volume, mute, pan)
  - TASK-004: Bidirectional sync (< 10ms latency)
  - TASK-005: MIDI Learn functionality
  - TASK-006: Save/Load projects
  - TASK-007: Visual feedback (on-screen faders)
- All tasks include: acceptance criteria, dependencies, technical notes, testing requirements, Definition of Done checklist

### What Was Learned
- Windsurf Wave 8+ uses `.windsurf/rules/` directory for agent rules (markdown format)
- Windsurf Workflows are markdown files in `.windsurf/workflows/` that guide Cascade through repeatable processes
- Workflows can be invoked with `/workflow-name` slash commands
- Need to balance "bleeding edge" tech with stability for audio professionals
- Critical constraint: < 10ms latency for MIDI-to-UCNet translation
- Phase 1 MVP must be ruthlessly scoped (7 locked features only)
- Task management system enforces "One Feature Rule" and tracks all work in individual task files

### Blockers / Issues
- None currently (planning phase complete)

### Next Steps
- Initialize Tauri v2 project structure
- Set up development environment (Rust toolchain, Node.js, dependencies)
- Create initial project scaffold with proper directory structure
- Set up testing infrastructure (Vitest + Cargo test)

### Key Decisions Made
- **ADR-001:** Tauri v2 over Electron (performance + size)
- **ADR-002:** SQLite over JSON files (reliability + queries)
- **ADR-003:** Event-driven IPC over polling (latency + CPU)
- **ADR-004:** Mock hardware I/O using Rust traits (testability)
- **ADR-005:** TailwindCSS over CSS-in-JS (speed + consistency)
- **ADR-006:** Vitest over Jest (Vite integration)

### Notes
- Project Charter defines "The No List" - common feature requests we will reject
- "One Feature Rule" enforced: Only one feature in development at a time
- Quality mantra: "Would I trust this in a live concert?"
